\chapter{Further Reading}

To pursue ordered sets further, the following list may offer some helpful starting points.

\begin{itemize}

  \item \citet[ch. 4]{Velleman2019} offers an introductory survey of the concept of order and relations, along with a thorough discussion of proofs about them.

  \item \citet[chs.~3, 5]{Warner2019} provide a helpful discussion of ordered sets and how ordering is defined for the different sets of numbers. There are fully worked examples and proofs.

  \item \citet[ch. 7]{Jongsma2019} covers the basic theorems and proofs that underlie the \mathical/ concept of order.
  
  \item \citet[ch. 4]{Pinter2014} provides a simple but rigorous discussion of ordered sets. Once you're comfortable reading simple proofs, this is a good chapter to try. 

  \item \citet{DaveyAndPriestly1990} provides thorough coverage of many classic topics studied under the \mathical/ concept of order, along with how these ideas are used in a variety of applications.

\end{itemize}
