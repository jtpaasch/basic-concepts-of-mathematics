\chapter{Further Reading}

To pursue the topic of equivalence classes and partitions further, the following list may offer some helpful starting points.

\begin{itemize}

  \item \citet[ch.~4]{StewartAndTall2015} provide an introductory-level discussion of equivalence relations.
  
  \item \citet[ch.~2]{Steinhart2018} also provides an excellent introduction for the beginner to the topic of equivalence relations.

  \item \citet[ch.~9]{Cummings2020} presents a slow discussion of equivalence relations and how to construct proofs about them.

  \item \citet[ch.~3]{Warner2019} provides a thorough and helpful discussion of equivalence relations, with fully worked examples and proofs.

  \item \citet[section 4.5]{Velleman2019} provides a discussion of equivalence relations and proofs about them.

  \item \citet[ch.~3]{Pinter2014} offers a simple discussion of some of the basic theorems and proofs about equivalence classes and quotient sets.

  \item \citet[ch.~6]{Jongsma2019} provides a rigorous introduction to some of the basic theorems and proofs about equivalence classes.
  
\end{itemize}
