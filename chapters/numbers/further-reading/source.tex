\chapter{Further Reading}

To pursue numbers further, the following list may offer some helpful starting points. 

\begin{itemize}

  \item \citet[ch.~1 and appendix A]{Cummings2018} provide an introduction to the real numbers and what they can be used for, as well as a discussion of how to construct the natural numbers, integers, rational numbers, and real numbers.

  \item \citet[chs.~6, 16]{Stewart1995} offers some beginner-level discussion of what the real numbers are used for.

  \item \citet[chs.~2, 9, 10]{StewartAndTall2015} offer a fairly thorough introduction to many of the issues surrounding the real numbers.
  
  \item \citet[ch.~5]{Warner2019} provides an excellent introduction to the natural numbers, integers, rational numbers, and real numbers. Warner constructs each set of numbers fully, and then defines addition, multiplication, and ordering on them. In doing so, Warner shows how all of these sets are built from the ground up.
  
  \item \citet[chs.~2, 3, 4, 6, and 14, 15]{MaddenAndAubrey2017} offer thorough coverage on the natural numbers, integers, rationals, and real numbers.
