\chapter{Preface}
\label{ch:preface}

The goal of this book is to introduce many of the basic concepts in modern \math/. The book is divided into different parts, each of which covers a separate topic. 

The first four parts (on \Mathical/ Method, Sets, Functions, and Relations) form the foundation that all of the other parts depend on. Any of the further parts beyond that foundation can be read independently.
