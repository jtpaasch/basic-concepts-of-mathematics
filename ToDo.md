# TO DO

Upgrades:

* To the relations chapter, add that there is cardinality, like functions.
* To the equivalence chapter, add as a note that \equiv is also a symbol used.
* To the functions-inverse chapter, note that a function cannot be inverted if it's surjective?
* To the relations chapter, add that inverses can be created.

* In the chapters on functions, point out that a function is a subset of the product.
* In the chapters on functions, add info about composition:
  * Add a section about composition to the chapter called "functions." 
  * Add to the "isomorphism" definition that a bijection is an isomorphism if f . f-1 = idA and f-1 . f = idB.
* Add composition about relations too.

* For all relevant "terminology" sections, add section backrefs to their original places.
* Refer to chapters by chapterref
* Add to rationals chapter that N and Z are subsets of Q.
* Mention the name "homomorphism" in algebra isomorphisms chapter.

* In isomorphism chapters, start with the tagline that two structures are essentially the same if they differ only in the names of their elements. But if everything else is the same (their structure is the same), then they are considered to be essentially the same (isomorphic, i.e., have the same shape)
  * Then say: how do we know if two structures differ only in their names? We can construct a function that translates between their names. 
  * It's not enough to translate only one way. Example: if S1 and S2 are structures, and S2 has more elements than S1.
  * Also, the structure has to be preserved. We're not simply pairing up items. We need the same structure on both sides.
